When the Google Reader cancellation hit on March 13, 2013, I decided to see if there was any modern feed reader to start using. It was either that or pay for something.

I found an old project call Feedjack -- built on Django but not updated since Django 1.0. Maybe I can get it into shape so it's usable again.

The original FeedJack page is at http://www.feedjack.org/

What follows is the original README

======================

Feedjack is a feed aggregator writen in Python using the Django web development
framework.

Like the Planet feed aggregator:

    * It downloads feeds and aggregate their contents in a single site
    * The new aggregated site has a feed of its own (atom and rss)
    * It uses Mark Pilgrim’s excelent FeedParser
    * The subscribers list can be exported as OPML and FOAF

But FeedJack also has some advantages:

    * It handles historical data, you can read old posts
    * It parses a lot more info, including post categories
    * It generates pages with posts of a certain category
    * It generates pages with posts from a certain subscriber
    * It generates pages with posts of a certain category from a certain
       subcriber
    * A cloud tag/folksonomy (hype 2.0 compliant) for every page and every
      subscriber
    * It uses Django templates
    * The administration is done via web (using Django's kickass autogenerated
      and magical admin site), and can handle multiple planets
    * Extensive use of django’s internal cache engine. Most of the time you
      will have no database hits when serving pages.
